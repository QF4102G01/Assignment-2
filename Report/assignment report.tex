\caption{Algorithm for pricing American arithmetic-Asian put}
\end{algorithm}

The American fixed-strike arithmetic-average put option is initiated 0.25 year ago, and has 0.25 year more to expiry. The underlier price is currently $\$100$, volatility $40$ and dividend yield 0.01 with a running average of $\$95$, which was taken over the earlier 0.25 year since launched. The risk-free rate $r_f$ is $0.1$ and strike price $K=
\$100$.

Compute the option value with $\rho=1$, $\rho=\dfrac{1}{2}$ and $\rho = \dfrac{1}{5}$. For each $\rho$, the number of periods in the lattice is required to be 50, 100, 200 and 400. Compare the computed results and the computation times taken.

We use the forward shooting grid method which on each grid point representing one underlying price and one current time, has an array to represent the option value based on different values of running average. The running average values branch out from the previous running average, which was a weighted average with the starting price of the underlying security. The stock price values branch out from the starting price of the underlying asset.

\subsection{Comment on the numerical results and computation times taken for different $\rho$ and $N$ values}
The different amoung of time taken and option prices for various set of $\rho$ and $N$ is shown below:

\hspace{23mm} When $\rho=1$:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
		\hline $\rho$ & $N$ & Option price & Time taken in $\mu s$\\
		[0.5ex]
		\hline 1 & 50 & 5.3942 & 0.41758 \\
		\hline 1 & 100 & 5.4301 & 2.3993 \\
		\hline 1 & 200 & 5.4552 & 16.218 \\
		\hline 1 & 400 & 5.4685 & 142.62 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\hspace{23mm} When $\rho=0.5$:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
		\hline $\rho$ & $N$ & Option price & Time taken in $\mu s$\\
		[0.5ex]
		\hline 0.5 & 50 & 5.36 & 0.61176 \\
		\hline 0.5 & 100 & 5.4181 & 4.0884 \\
		\hline 0.5 & 200 & 5.4487 & 34.326 \\
		\hline 0.5 & 400 & 5.4639 & 291.35 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\hspace{23mm} When $\rho=0.2$:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
		\hline $\rho$ & $N$ & Option price & Time taken in $\mu s$\\
		[0.5ex]
		\hline 0.2 & 50 & 5.3533 & 1.3995 \\
		\hline 0.2 & 100 & 5.412 & 10.18 \\
		\hline 0.2 & 200 & 5.4446 & 89.083 \\
		\hline 0.2 & 400 & 5.4487 & 706.65 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Regarding the option value, using the same $\rho$ value, as $N$ increases, the estimated option value increases from $N = 50$ to $N = 400$. The time taken for the program to finish also increase. As $N
$ becomes two times the previous value, the run time becomes about 8 times the previous value, implying that the time complexity is cubic with reference to $N$. This is significant improvement from the two-state-variable BTM, which takes $O(2^n)$ for the computation in each backward iteration.

Across different values of $\rho$, with the same $N$ value, we observe that the option price obtained is lowered. This is due to the fact that the discretized grids are more finely divided, leading to the payoff at each state being interpolating and landing on a more exact and well-approximated value. Also the run time increases approximately 2 times when we change $\rho=1$ to $\rho=0.5$, and approximately 5 times when we change $\rho=1$ to $\rho=0.2$, which implies that the time complexity of this method is linear with reference to $\rho$.

\subsection{FSGM for American fixed-strike lookback put option}
Next, an American fixed-strike lookback put option is concerned, initiated 0.25 year ago, and still having 0.25 year to expiry. The current underlier price $S_{0.25}=\$1$, volatility $\sigma=40\%$ and dividend yield $q = 0.01$. The running minimum is at $\$0.97$ which was taken over the earlier period of 0.25 year. The risk-free rate $r_f=0.1$ and strike $K=\$0.95$.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\setstretch{1.5}
	\KwData{runningTime, $\tau$, $S_0$, $\sigma$, $q$, $A$(running minimum), $r$, $K$, $N$}
	\KwResult{$P_{FSGM}$, Option Premium}
	$\Delta t$ = $\dfrac{\tau}{N}$;
	$\Delta x = \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}$;
	$u = e^{\Delta x}$;
	$d = e^{-\Delta x}$;
	$p = \dfrac{e^{(r-q) \Delta t} - d}{u - d}$\;
	\For {$j = 0$ to $N$} {
		\For {$k = \dfrac{-N}{\rho}$ to $\dfrac{N}{\rho}$} {
			$v(j, k) = max(K - A \exp(k \Delta x))$;
		}
	}
	\For {$n = N-1$ to $1$} {
		\For {$j = 0$ to $n$} {
			\For {$k = -\frac{n}{\rho}, -frac{n}{\rho}+1, \dots, \frac{n}{\rho}$} {
				$S = S_{0} e^{(2j - n) \Delta x}$\;
				$A' = A e^{k \Delta x}$\;
				$A_{up} = \min(A', Su)$\;
				$A_{down} = \min(A', Sd)$\;
				$k_{u} = round(\ln(\frac{A_{up}}{A}) / \Delta x)$\;
				$k_{d} = round(\ln(\frac{A_{down}}{A}) / \Delta x)$\;
				$v_{u} = v(A e^{k_{u}\Delta x}, Su)$\;
				$v_{d} = v(A e^{k_{d}\Delta x}, Sd)$\;
				$v(j,k) = \max(e^{-r \Delta t}(pv_{u} + (1-p)v_{d}), K - A')$;
			}
		}
	}
\caption{Algorithm for pricing American lookback put}
\end{algorithm}

We use the forward shooting grid method which on each grid point representing one underlying price and one current time. Different from the algorithm for Asian option, we are not using array to represent different values of running minimum on each grid point, and we are not interpolating to obtain to value shot from each grid point. The stock price values branch out from the starting price of the underlying asset.

\subsection{Comment on the numerical results and computation times taken for different $N$ values}
Compute the function for number of time periods $N = 50$ to $N = 500$ with increments of 50, and comment on the numerical results and computation time taken. Lastly, re-run the algorithm with running minimum changed from $\$0.97$ to $\$0.57$.

\subsection{Comment on the numerical results obtained from lower running minimum value}
The option values for the running minimum of $\$0.57$ is always $\$0.38$, because the current underlying asset price $\$1$ is too high that it is highly improbable for the future underlier price to be lower than the running minimum, and it is more beneficial to exercise the option immediately at the current time.

\section{Explicit Difference Scheme III for vanilla call option}
\subsection*{\emph{Statement of the problem}}
Write a MatLab function to implement the explicit difference scheme III for pricing European vanilla calls. Test the algorithm out with a European vanilla call option with strike $K = \$9$, time to maturity $0.25$ year, current underlier price $S = \$9.8$, volatility $\sigma=0.15$. The dividend yield $q = 1\%$ and risk-free rate is $0.1\%$.
